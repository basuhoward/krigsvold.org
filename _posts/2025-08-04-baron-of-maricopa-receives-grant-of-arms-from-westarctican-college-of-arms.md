**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Baron of Maricopa Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Arthur Langer, Baron of Maricopa, has been granted armorial bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms, *Per chevron Sable and Argent, two Celtic crosses Argent and a scorpion tergiant Sable*, reflect a fusion of spiritual conviction and tenacity, echoing both classical symbolism and modern resilience. The crest—a *hippogriff passant, foreparts Sable, forelegs and beak Argent, hindquarters and crined Azure*—embodies a bold union of grounded strength and visionary aspiration. Accompanying elements include a personal badge (*a scorpion’s dexter claw Sable on a field Argent within a lozenge voided Sable*) and a Westarctican-style standard featuring alternating scorpions and bald eagles drawn from the iconography of the United States.

The motto, **Endurance, Commitment, Persistence**, ties the visual language of the arms to the values of the barony, articulating a vision of service rooted in integrity and perseverance.

This grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on August 2, 2025, and is officially recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. The Baron of Maricopa and his successors are now entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity with full recognition across the Grand Duchy.
