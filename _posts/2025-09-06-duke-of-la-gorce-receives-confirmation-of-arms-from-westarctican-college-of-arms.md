**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Duke of La Gorce Receives Confirmation of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Yannick Beuvelet, Duke of La Gorce, has received official confirmation of his armorial bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms—*Argent, a bordure compony Azure and Or, a griffon segreant Gules*—reflect the Duke’s honor, vigilance, and loyalty to the realm. The design draws upon heraldic tradition while recognizing the continuity of symbols associated with his name and station.

His crest, *a paschal lamb proper*, embodies peace and faith, while the supporters—*two sea-lions combatant Or, langued, armed, and finned Azure*—represent courage and steadfastness in service to Westarctica. Together, these elements form a complete heraldic achievement expressive of dignity and fidelity. The motto, *Pax Et Bonum*, recalls enduring values of goodwill and harmony.

The arms were confirmed by Ellsworth King of Arms in July 2025 and are now formally recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. His Grace and his successors are entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity, with full rights under the heraldic customs of the Grand Duchy.
