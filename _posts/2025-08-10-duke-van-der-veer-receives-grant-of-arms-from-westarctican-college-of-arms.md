**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Duke Van der Veer Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Sean Blasdall, Duke Van der Veer, has been granted armorial bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms—*Argent, a saltire between in fess two crescents and between in pale two of the Mon Vert, on a chief Vert three garbs Or*—are a harmonious blend of traditional heraldry and personal symbolism. The green saltire and crescents suggest steadfastness and renewal, while the golden garbs speak to prosperity and stewardship. The inclusion of the Japanese Mon reflects the Duke’s cultural inspiration, integrated seamlessly into a Western heraldic framework.

The crest, *a snow petrel rising Proper*, embodies vigilance and resilience in the polar environment. As supporter, *a kraken Purpure armed Or*, seated to dexter with its tentacles extended behind and around the shield, conveys both guardianship and dynamic strength. The badge—*the Mon Vert, upon it a snow petrel rising Proper*—serves as a personal emblem for less formal or smaller-scale use, while the standard displays the arms’ primary devices and motto in the Westarctican style.

The grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on August 2, 2025, and is officially recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. The Duke Van der Veer and his successors are entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity, with full rights under the heraldic customs of the Grand Duchy.
