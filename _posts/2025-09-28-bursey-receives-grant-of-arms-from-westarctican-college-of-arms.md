**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Bursey Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Christian Klempsmann,
Viscount of Bursey and Companion of Westarctica, has been granted armorial
bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms, *Argent, three chevronels Gules, in dexter canton a Southern Cross of
estoiles Sable*, unite the heritage of Ravensberg with a passion for astronomy.
The chevrons recall the historic arms of Bielefeld and the County of Ravensberg,
while the Southern Cross signifies the armiger’s service and connection to the
European Southern Observatory. The crest—*a balance Gules, the pans pendant and
balanced Argent*—symbolizes equity and judgment. The motto, **UT OMNES UNUM
SINT** (“That they all may be one”), expresses an enduring commitment to unity.

A personal badge accompanies the grant: *On a roundel Sable a Southern Cross of
estoiles Argent*. This compact emblem provides a distinctive mark for seals,
standards, and other personal uses.

This grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on September 6, 2025, and is
officially recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms.
Christian Klempsmann and his heirs are now entitled to bear these arms in
perpetuity with full recognition across the Grand Duchy.
