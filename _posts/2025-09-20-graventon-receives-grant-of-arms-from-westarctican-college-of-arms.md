**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Graventon Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Vasilios Dimopoulos of Graventon has been granted armorial bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms, *Vert, a saltire between four fleurs-de-lys Argent*, unite Marian symbolism with bold simplicity. The fleur-de-lys recalls purity and devotion, while the saltire creates a strong heraldic structure and balance. The crest—*an owl Argent holding a cross Vert in the dexter talon*—speaks to wisdom rooted in Greek heritage, joined with steadfast faith. The motto, **Πάντοτε ζητεῖν τὴν ἀλήθειαν** (“Always seeking the truth”), encapsulates the ideals of knowledge and integrity that shape the armiger’s character.

Two personal badges accompany the grant: *a roundel Vert charged with the Virgin Mary proper* and *a fleur-de-lys Argent banded Vert*. These serve as compact emblems of devotion and identity, suited for seals, standards, and personal display.

This grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on September 6, 2025, and is officially recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. Vasilios Dimopoulos and his heirs are now entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity with full recognition across the Grand Duchy.
