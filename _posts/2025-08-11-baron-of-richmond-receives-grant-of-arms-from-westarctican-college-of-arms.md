**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Baron of Richmond Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Matthew Charles Stock, Baron of Richmond, has been granted armorial bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms, *Azure, a mountain Argent rising from base, in chief a sun in splendour Or eclipsed Sable*, convey a striking juxtaposition of natural beauty and celestial power. The snow-capped mountain speaks to enduring strength and steadfastness, while the eclipsed sun symbolizes a balance of light and shadow, vision and humility. The crest—a *royal albatross rising wings addorsed Argent beaked Or*—embodies freedom, resilience, and far-reaching purpose.

Accompanying elements include a personal badge (*a sun in splendour Or eclipsed Sable*) and a Westarctican-style standard bearing three bends Or inscribed with the motto **Sub Umbra Alarum Tuarum** in letters Sable, with the crest and badge alternating in chief and base. This arrangement reflects both the protective nature and guiding spirit of the Barony.

This grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on August 4, 2025, and is officially recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. The Baron of Richmond and his successors are now entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity with full recognition across the Grand Duchy.
