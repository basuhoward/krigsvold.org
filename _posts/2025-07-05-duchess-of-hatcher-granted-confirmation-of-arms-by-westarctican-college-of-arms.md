**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Duchess of Hatcher Granted Confirmation of Arms by Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms proudly announces the formal confirmation and
registration of armorial bearings for Elisa Ghirardi, Duchess of Hatcher and
Baroness of Jacobel Glacier, under the authority of the Westarctican College of
Arms.

The confirmation recognizes arms long borne and associated with the Duchess in
connection with her noble standing, now officially entered into the heraldic
records of the Grand Duchy. The arms, **Per chevron Argent and Azure, in chief
three snow crystals one and two of the second, in base an iceberg proper**,
evoke the polar identity and elegant distinction of her titles. The crest
features a **pelican vulning Argent**, symbolizing self-sacrifice and devotion,
while her supporters, **two herons respectant Argent**, reinforce dignity,
patience, and grace.

Dame Elisa, a member of the Order of the Snowflake, has consistently exemplified
the virtues of the Westarctican peerage. This act of confirmation honors that
legacy and secures the heraldic identity of her house and successors in
perpetuity.

The grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on July 5, 2025, and is now
entered into the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms as the official
Arms of the Duchess of Hatcher and her heirs.
