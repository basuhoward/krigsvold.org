**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Duke of Haines Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Larry Ransom, Duke of Haines, has been granted armorial bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms—*Per chevron Azure and Argent, three parachutes Or in fess and an anchor Azure; on a chief Argent a battle axe Azure bladed Or*—speak to the Duke’s lifelong commitment to discipline, leadership, and resilience. The design evokes both personal history and principled service, while integrating modern symbolism into the heraldic tradition.

His crest, *a dragon passant Azure, wings elevated and addorsed, armed and langued Or*, reinforces those same themes of strength and vigilance. The supporters—*an orca haurient proper* and *an emperor penguin proper*—are emblematic of grace and determination within the polar realm. The badge, a variation of the crest, depicts the dragon *maintaining a battle axe Azure bladed Or*, while the standard features the anchor as central emblem, flanked by twin badges and a motto inscribed in gold.

The arms were granted by Ellsworth King of Arms in August 2025 and are now formally recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. His Grace and his successors are entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity, with full rights under the heraldic customs of the Grand Duchy.
