**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Duke of Ochs Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Jonas Schmidt, Duke of Ochs and Knight Commander of the Order of the Snowflake, has been granted armorial bearings under the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The arms—*Quarterly per saltire; in chief, a dove rising Or on Purpure; in dexter, a Torii gate Gules before a mountain snow-capped proper on Bleu Celeste; in base, a violin bendwise sinister proper on Vert; in sinister, a rose Gules slipped and leaved proper on Or; overall a snowflake Argent*—express a unification of the Duke’s personal ideals and cultural inspirations under the values of peace, freedom, and acceptance. The overall snowflake symbolizes Westarctica itself, binding together diverse aspects of life and service within a shared polar identity.

The supporters—*to dexter, a white ox statant guardant proper, attired and unguled Argent; to sinister, a phoenix Azure rising, wings displayed and elevated*—represent steadfast strength and renewal. The arms rest upon *a stylized ice floe proper* and are accompanied by the motto **_Ex glacie florent pax, libertas et acceptio_**, meaning “From the ice shall bloom peace, freedom, and acceptance.”

This grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on November 4, 2025, and is officially recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. The Duke of Ochs and his successors are now entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity with full heraldic recognition across the Grand Duchy.
