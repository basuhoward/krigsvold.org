**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Duke of Waite Receives Grant of Arms from Westarctican College of Arms**

The Ellsworth King of Arms is pleased to announce that Thomas Williams, Duke of
Waite, has been granted armorial bearings by the Ellsworth King of Arms under
the authority of the Westarctican College of Arms.

The formal grant recognizes Duke Williams's distinguished service to the Grand
Duchy of Westarctica, including his roles as Knight Commander of the Order of
the Snowflake and Companion of the Noble Order of Westarctica. The newly granted
arms, **Vert, a Tree of Life Argent, on a chief Azure three estoiles Or**,
symbolize resilience, aspiration, and nobility, while the accompanying crest,
supporters, badge, and standard reflect a deep connection to both natural
symbolism and Westarctica's polar identity.

This grant reinforces Westarctica's heraldic tradition as a sovereign
micronation committed to recognizing virtue, loyalty, and service through
enduring symbols of honor.

The grant was issued by Ellsworth King of Arms on July 5, 2025, and is duly
recorded in the registers of the Westarctican College of Arms. The Duke of Waite
and his successors are now entitled to bear these arms in perpetuity, with full
heraldic rights recognized throughout the Grand Duchy.
