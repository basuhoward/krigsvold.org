The Count of Krigsvold is an institutional role held by James P. Howard, II. The
office is oriented toward climate education, with a particular focus on
Antarctica and related polar systems, and it is pursued through structured
public explanation, careful advocacy, and support for research aligned with that
educational mission.

The Count's work is organized around clarity, continuity, and respect for
established scientific and academic institutions. It is intended to complement,
rather than duplicate, the efforts of researchers and organizations that
directly conduct polar science.

## Purpose of the office

The Count's purpose is to advance public understanding of climate change by
focusing attention on polar environments, particularly those in Antarctica that
influence sea level, ocean circulation, and global climate dynamics. Polar
systems often provide unusually clear evidence of physical change, and they can
illuminate processes that are otherwise difficult to observe at lower latitudes.

A fuller statement of the Count's approach is provided on the Mission and Method
page.

## Scope and limits

The Count does not exercise governmental authority, regulatory jurisdiction, or
scientific adjudication. The office does not claim sovereignty, territory, or
policy-making power. Its role is educational and institutional, emphasizing the
interpretation of credible science and the communication of why polar systems
matter globally.

Where the site references real Antarctic features associated with the Count's
titles, those references are used as organizing frameworks rather than
assertions of ownership or jurisdiction.

## Work and activities

The Count's activities fall into three broad categories:

- **Education and interpretation:** providing structured explanation of polar
  climate systems and the mechanisms through which Antarctic change affects the
  global climate.
- **Structured advocacy:** improving climate awareness through careful framing
  and sustained presentation of evidence rather than political messaging or
  calls to action.
- **Research support:** encouraging and recognizing work that contributes to
  clearer public understanding of polar science.

These categories are described in more detail on the Research Support and
Fellowship pages.

## Background

James P. Howard, II has a professional background in mathematics, statistics,
and data science, with experience in public policy and public health. This
perspective informs the Count's emphasis on evidence, interpretability, and
institutional clarity.

## Relationship to Westarctica

The title Count of Krigsvold is held within the Grand Duchy of Westarctica, a
nonprofit organization oriented toward awareness and advocacy for Western
Antarctica. The Count's work as presented on this site is undertaken
independently within the educational and institutional framework described here.

For information on Westarctica itself, readers may consult its official website.

## Closing perspective

The Count's work rests on a simple proposition: that public understanding
improves when complex systems are explained clearly, consistently, and with
respect for scientific reality. Antarctica is remote, but its climate
significance is direct. By focusing attention on polar systems, the Count of
Krigsvold seeks to clarify why climate change is not only a subject of debate,
but a set of measurable physical processes with long-term global consequences.
