Welcome to the heraldry page for the Count of Krigsvold. This page presents a
comprehensive examination of the arms of dominion that symbolize the nobility
and responsibility bestowed upon Dr. Howard in his capacity as a protector and
steward of these territories. Each component of the heraldry has been
meticulously designed to reflect the heritage, duties, and personal commitments
of the Count, intertwining ancient symbols with modern values to represent a
legacy of conservation, leadership, and dedication.

Here, we explore the rich symbolism and historical context behind the creation
of these arms. From the icy fields of the Antarctic, represented by the County
of Krigsvold, to the verdant symbolism of the Lithuanian heritage in the Barony
of Matikonis, these arms narrate a story of exploration, endurance, and the
unyielding duty to guard and cherish the natural world. Each element has been
carefully chosen to honor past achievements and inspire ongoing commitment to
the responsibilities these noble titles carry.

Dr. James P. Howard, II, holds a distinctive [grant of
arms](https://jameshoward.us/malta) provided by the Chief Herald of
Malta, reflective of his personal virtues and scholarly pursuits:

> Argent in pale a tetrahedron Azure pierced in bend by a sword Or with pommel
> and cross piece of the Second. Crest--Upon a helm befitting his degree with
> mantling Azure and doubled Or is set for crest, upon a wreath of the liveries
> a martlet Sable.  Motto--_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_, Maltese for "Only the
> will leads the heart."

These arms are emblematic of Dr. Howard's dedication to knowledge and
leadership, symbolized by the sword piercing through the tetrahedron,
representing intellectual breakthrough and strength. The martlet in the
crest is a heraldic charge often used to signify continuous quest for
knowledge.

## Heraldic Protocol on Additaments

When utilizing a grant of arms across different heraldic jurisdictions,
it is crucial to adhere to specific protocols to maintain the integrity
and respect due to such symbols.  Here, a significant consideration
involves the external ornaments or additaments:

* Respect for Jurisdictional Boundaries--Heraldic traditions vary
  significantly across different cultures and legal frameworks. It is
  generally inappropriate to mix external ornaments, such as supporters
  or crowns, from one jurisdiction (e.g., Malta) with those from another
  (e.g., Westarctica).  Each set of arms should maintain its decorations
  and symbols as granted and be used distinctly to respect the heraldic
  authority and cultural heritage they represent.

* Avoiding Misrepresentation--Mixing elements from different grants can
  lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the status or entitlements
  represented by the arms. For example, using Maltese-specific symbols
  or additaments on a Westarctican coat of arms might falsely imply
  endorsements or honors not actually bestowed by those authorities.

This adherence not only respects the traditions and legalities of
heraldic practice but also ensures that each coat of arms retains its
intended significance and honor. Dr. Howard's approach to maintaining
separate heraldic identities for his titles and honors upholds these
principles, ensuring clarity and propriety in their display and usage.

## Arms of the County of Krigsvold

The County of Krigsvold draws its name and heraldic inspiration from a
poignant figure in Antarctic exploration history. The Krigsvold Nunataks
were named in honor of [Sgt. Alvin I.
Krigsvold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss_Glacier#Krigsvold_Nunataks),
a member of the United States Army. In 1956, Sgt. Krigsvold played a
crucial role in the [Army-Navy Trail
Party](https://www.nytimes.com/1956/12/03/archives/antarctic-trail-party-conquers-crevasse-zone-in-roadbuilding.html)
that established a trail from [Little America
V](https://www.britannica.com/place/Little-America-research-station-Antarctica)
to [Byrd Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrd_Station), a feat of
endurance and bravery that facilitated subsequent scientific and
exploratory work in Antarctica.

The name "Krigsvold," which can be interpreted from German or Norwegian
as "war violence" or more poetically as "bastion of war," reflects the
harsh and challenging conditions of Antarctica that Sgt. Krigsvold and
his team had to overcome. This historical backdrop informs the symbolic
elements of the Krigsvold coat of arms, emphasizing themes of
protection, resilience, and vigilance. 

The arms of the County of Krigsvold are designed to symbolize the
protective and enduring spirit of its namesake, infused with elements
that reflect both the Antarctic environment and the historical
narrative:

> Azure, a snowflake Argent, a chief engrailed of the same. Crest--A castle
> Eisenfarb. Supporters--On either side, a penguin Proper, each with the inner
> wing extended supporting the shield, and crowned with an eastern crown Or,
> standing upon a compartment of snow-covered rocks.  Motto--_Dies müssen wir
> schützen_, German for "This we must protect."

The arms of the County of Krigsvold are a contemporary creation that
draws deeply from historical and environmental themes. By incorporating
elements like the snowflake, castle, and penguins, the coat of arms
creates a bridge between the past deeds of explorers like Sgt. Krigsvold
and the ongoing mission to protect and study the Antarctic region.

The use of traditional heraldic symbolism to convey modern values of
conservation and memory demonstrates the dynamic nature of heraldry as a
form of cultural expression that honors heritage while addressing
contemporary concerns.

## Arms of the Barony of Matikonis

The Barony of Matikonis is named in honor of [William P.
Matikonis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulter_Heights#Matikonis_Peak),
a dedicated Damage Controlman aboard the [USS
_Glacier_](https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2024/february/ice-uss-glacier-agb-4-antarctica)
during the significant 1961-62 Antarctic expedition. His role was
pivotal in supporting the logistical and operational needs that
facilitated extensive research and exploration in Antarctica. This
connection to Antarctic exploration and support staff underpins the
heraldic symbols of the Barony of Matikonis.

{% include figure.html placement="right" width="6"
   image="armorial/matikonis.svg"
   alt="Arms of the Barony of Matikonis" cap="Arms of the Barony of Matikonis" %}

The coat of arms of the Barony of Matikonis incorporates elements that
reflect both the Antarctic legacy and the Lithuanian heritage of the
namesake:

> Per pale Gules and Vert, an oak tree Counterchanged fructed Or. Crest--Arising
> from an eastern crown, an oak sprig Proper fructed Or.  Supporters--At dexter,
> a sea-unicorn Gules; at sinister, a sea-unicorn Vert; both rampant, scaled and
> armed Argent, horned and crined Or, gorged with an eastern crown Or, standing
> upon a compartment of snow-covered rocks. Motto--_Amžinai budėkime_,
> Lithuanian for "Let us stand guard forever."

The heraldic elements chosen for the Barony of Matikonis intertwine the
personal history of William P. Matikonis with broader themes of heritage
and duty. The oak tree, a national symbol of strength in Lithuania,
underscores the resilience required in Antarctic conditions and serves
as a metaphor for the steadfast support staff who enable exploration and
scientific achievements.

The use of mythical sea-unicorns as supporters adds a layer of narrative
about the mysteries and wonders of the Antarctic, often perceived as a
remote and mythical place itself. These elements together create a coat
of arms that is rich in symbolism and narrative depth, celebrating the
spirit of exploration and the cultural heritage of the barony's
namesake.
